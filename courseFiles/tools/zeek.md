# Zeek — SOC Analyst Playbook (Cheat-sheet + Expanded)

> Zeek (formerly Bro) is an event-driven network security engine that passively monitors traffic, parses protocols, extracts metadata and generates rich logs for detection, hunting and incident response. This playbook combines a short, usable cheat-sheet (like your original doc) with the expanded SOC-focused guidance you added later.

---


### 1. Quick installs

- **Debian/Ubuntu (package)**

```bash
sudo apt install zeek
```

- **From source (recommended for advanced options/plugins)**

NOT RECOMMENDED

- **Docker (testing / labs)**

```bash
docker run --rm -it --net=host zeek/zeek zeek -i eth0
```

- **Appliances / Distros**: Security Onion, Corelight, and other sensors often ship Zeek pre-integrated.

---

### 2. Deployment patterns & capture modes

- **Single-node**: capture + logs locally. Good for labs and small sites.
- **Clustered**: manager + workers + proxies + logger. Use for scale; coordinate scripts across nodes (zeekctl deploy / zkg).
- **Sensor + SIEM**: sensors forward logs to central SIEM / Kafka / syslog / Filebeat.

**Packet capture modes**
- `libpcap` — default, easy.
- `AF_PACKET` — high-throughput Linux capture.
- `DPDK` / specialized NIC plugins — very high throughput (requires extra setup).

---

### 3. Core components & frameworks

- **Packet acquisition** (pcap/af_packet/dpdk)
- **Analyzer pipeline / Event engine** — protocol parsers emit high-level events (HTTP, DNS, TLS, etc.)
- **Scripting / Policy engine** — Zeek scripts consume events and produce logs/notices
- **Logging framework** — TSV by default; JSON/NDJSON through packages or policies
- **Frameworks** — Notice, Intel, Logging, Cluster, File Analysis, Input, etc.

---

### 4. Important Zeek logs (SOC priorities)

| Log file | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| `conn.log` | Connection metadata (5-tuple, bytes, duration, state) — base for many detections |
| `dns.log` | DNS queries/answers — detect tunneling, suspicious qnames |
| `http.log` | HTTP request/response metadata — C2, exfil, suspicious URIs |
| `ssl.log` / `tls.log` | TLS handshake metadata, fingerprinting fields (JA3-like) |
| `x509.log` | Parsed certificates data (issuer, CN, validity) |
| `files.log` | Files observed/extracted (hashes, analyzers, sizes) |
| `notice.log` | Alerts / framework notices generated by scripts |
| `weird.log` | Parser anomalies & protocol oddities |
| `ssh.log` | SSH handshake metadata — lateral movement, anomalies |
| `smtp.log` | Email transfer metadata |

Zeek can emit many more logs (SMB, RDP, QUIC, DHCP, NTP, etc.). Enable what you need.

---

### 5. Log formats, rotation & shipping

- **Default format**: TSV with header comments describing fields/types.
- **JSON/NDJSON**: Use packages or custom policy to emit JSON for direct ingestion into Elastic/Kafka.
- **Rotation**: Configure rotation intervals and use post-rotate hooks to compress/ship logs.
- **Shipping pipelines**: Filebeat → Logstash → Elasticsearch, Kafka → consumers, syslog → SIEM. Ensure shipper and Zeek rotation are aligned.
- **Inspection tool**: `zeek-cut` to extract columns from TSV logs.

---

### 6. Enrichment & normalization (SOC needs)

- GeoIP / ASN enrichment for IP context.
- Map IPs to asset inventory (owner, role) for prioritization.
- Use Community ID / Netflow identifiers to link flows across sensors.
- Feed threat intel into Zeek's Intelligence Framework for IOC matching in real time.

---

### 7. Zeek scripting essentials (what analysts must know)

- **Event-driven**: handlers like `event connection_established(c: connection)` or `event http_request(c, method, host, uri)` run on events.
- **Types**: `int`, `string`, `addr`, `port`, `time`, plus `record`, `vector`, `table`, `set`.
- **redef**: override policy variables or thresholds.
- **@load / zkg**: load packages and community scripts.
- **Notice & Logging frameworks**: use them to produce alerts and structured output.

**Script placement**: `site/local.zeek` or `site/` under your Zeek prefix; distribute to cluster nodes (zeekctl deploy).

---



### 8. Testing, debugging & workflows

- **Test against PCAP**: `zeek -Cr capture.pcap site/local.zeek` or `zeek -Cr capture.pcap suspicious-posts.zeek`.
- **Run live**: `zeek -i eth0 site/local.zeek` (monitor CPU / drops).
- **zeekctl**: `zeekctl check`, `zeekctl deploy`, `zeekctl status` in ZeekControl-managed setups.
- **Debug**: `stderr` output, `notice.log`, `weird.log`, and `print()` statements during dev.

---

### 9. Performance tuning & operating tips

- Prefer AF_PACKET or DPDK for heavy traffic.
- Avoid expensive operations in hot events; e.g., heavy regexes or large table lookups on every packet.
- Rate-limit notices and use sampling for noisy content.
- Monitor packet drops and queue sizes; dropped packets mean blindspots.
- Rotate logs and align with your shipper to prevent data loss.

---

### 10. Integrations & community packages

- **zkg (Zeek Package Manager)** — install community packages.
- **Add-ons**: JSON loggers, Kafka producers, AF_PACKET/DPDK capture plugins.
- **SIEM**: Filebeat has Zeek modules; Kafka consumers, Logstash Grok patterns for TSV.
- **Community**: Official repos, Book of Zeek, Zeek mailing lists and Slack/Matrix communities.

---

### 11. Cheat-sheet / Useful commands

- Run Zeek on interface: `zeek -i eth0`
- Process PCAP: `zeek -Cr file.pcap`
- zeekctl: `zeekctl deploy | stop | status | check`
- Extract columns: `zeek-cut id.orig_h id.orig_p id.resp_h id.resp_p < conn.log`
- Install zkg package: `zkg install <package>` then `zkg load <package>`

---

### 12. Hunting recipes (quick mapping)

- **Lateral movement**: `conn.log` (internal IP spikes), `ssh.log` (unusual keys/logins).
- **DNS tunneling**: `dns.log` with very long qnames, high qps for single host, entropy checks.
- **C2 beaconing**: regular periodic small connections in `conn.log` / `http.log`; check intervals / jitter.
- **Exfiltration**: large POST bodies (`http.log` + `files.log`) or unusual transfers in `files.log`.
- **TLS anomalies**: mismatched CNs, expired/self-signed certs in `x509.log` / `ssl.log`.

---

### 13. Governance, retention & privacy

- Comply with legal/regulatory retention requirements.
- Avoid storing raw PII or credentials unless approved — redact/hide or hash before long-term storage.
- Coordinate with legal/privacy teams if you plan to persist payloads or extracted files.

---


### 14. Best Practices

- Periodically rotate and archive logs
- Forward logs to SIEM for correlation
- Watch `notice.log` and `weird.log` daily
- Write custom scripts for your use cases
- Leverage Zeek + Suricata (Security Onion) for layered detection
